- ✅ Fully translatable with i18n support
- ✅ Provides action hooks and filters for extensibility
- ✅ No settings required - works out of the box

## Requirements

- **WordPress**: 5.8 or higher
- **PHP**: 7.4 or higher
- **Zero BS CRM** (Jetpack CRM): Any version
- **MySQL**: 5.7 or higher

## Installation

### From this repository

1. Download the plugin files
2. Upload the `add-to-admin-menu` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. The admin bar links will appear automatically (requires Zero BS CRM to be active)

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Extract to your WordPress `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate through the WordPress admin panel

## Usage

Once activated, the plugin automatically adds two new items to the WordPress admin bar:

1. **New → Contact** - Links to the "Add New Contact" page in Zero BS CRM
2. **New → Company** - Links to the "Add New Company" page in Zero BS CRM

No configuration needed! The links will only appear if:
- Zero BS CRM is installed and activated
- The current user has the appropriate capabilities (`admin_zerobs_customers` or `manage_options`)

## User Capabilities

The plugin checks for the following capabilities before displaying the admin bar links:

- `admin_zerobs_customers` (Zero BS CRM's custom capability)
- `manage_options` (fallback for administrators)

Only users with these capabilities will see the admin bar menu items.

## Troubleshooting

### The admin bar links don't appear

**Possible causes:**
1. Zero BS CRM is not installed or activated
2. You don't have the required user capabilities
3. The admin bar is hidden in your user profile settings

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Zero BS CRM (Jetpack CRM) is active
2. Log in as an administrator
3. Check that "Show Toolbar when viewing site" is enabled in your user profile

### The links go to the wrong page

**Solution:**
The default URLs work with standard Zero BS CRM installations. If you're using a customized version, you can use the `zbscrm_admin_bar_add_contact_url` and `zbscrm_admin_bar_add_company_url` filters to adjust the URLs.

### Dependency warning appears

**Cause:** Zero BS CRM is not installed or activated.

**Solution:** Install and activate [Zero BS CRM (Jetpack CRM)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-bs-crm/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this work with Jetpack CRM?

Yes! Zero BS CRM was rebranded as Jetpack CRM. This plugin works with both the legacy "Zero BS CRM" and the current "Jetpack CRM".

### Does this plugin modify Zero BS CRM?

No, this plugin only adds shortcuts to the WordPress admin bar. It doesn't modify any Zero BS CRM functionality.

### Can I customize the menu item labels?

Yes, but you'll need to use WordPress translation filters or modify the plugin code. The text is translatable using the `zbscrm-admin-bar-links` text domain.

### Does this work on the front end?

Yes, if the admin bar is visible on the front end (for logged-in users), the links will appear there as well.
